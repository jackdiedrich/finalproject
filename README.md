# Final Project

## Introduction

This is a final project for the [Interacting with Data](https://github.com/Brown-BIOL2430-S04-Fall2015/syllabus) seminar in fall 2015. This project (a very brief, ie 1-2 sentence, overview of the project)...

To view this project, ... (embed visualization here or provide instructions on how to view the project).

## The data

- The data source for this project is unpublished, and therefore the true names for the data have been substituded by fake names and values have been replaced by randomly generated numbers that fall within the range of true values. 
- The data represented here are morphometric variables. Some are linear morphological measurements, some are area, and some are mass. In addition to these continuous variables, there are several characterizations that are discrete.

## Background

Since this data is currently unpublished, I am unable to provide links and images to previously existing graphics. However, in this dataset we are dealing with 178 points that fit into 9 groups. Consequently, the use of color to distinguish groups isn't very effective with so many different colors. In addition, while the reader may be able to distinguish groups based on color, many of the points represent specific species of interest that have been extensively studied, and the viewer may want to find a specific species on the plot. Therefore, an interactive approach would allow the viewer to highlight objects of interest, and allowing the viewer to interact with the phylogeny would allow them to gain some context for the distribution at different areas in the tree. 

## This project

### Mapping of data to aesthetics

How will aesthetic attributes ( X / Y / color / shape / size /texture / etc ) will be mapped to the data?

### Filtering

Are data filtered? ie in some views are some data not mapped to particular attributes of the image? What is the goal of the filtering?

### Extra ink

Are there aesthetic attributes that are not mapped to the data? If so, what purpose do they serve ( redundancy for robustness / improve visual metaphor / but data in context / beauty / etc )?

Are any data mapped to more than one aesthetic attribute? Why?

### Motion

If motion is used, what purpose does it serve ( metaphor (eg representing motion in real world) / transition continuity between views / etc )

### Perspective

To what extent is perspective (eg mappings) controlled by users vs hard coded in advance? How does this project aid in exploration vs exposition?

## Assessment

Was the new visualization successful at providing insight that was not possible or more difficult with previous approaches?

What are the main limitations of new approach?

What are future directions this could go in?
